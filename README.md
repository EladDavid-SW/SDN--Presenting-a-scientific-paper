A presentation as part of my studies about Software-Defined Networking (SDN). <br/>
My partner Inbar Shmaya and I presented together. <br/>
The presentation is about malicious software threats on SDN controllers and how we can detect those threats using Machine Learning algorithms.<br/>
Attached a link to the academic research and our power point file.
