# SDN--Presenting-a-scientific-paper
A presentation as part of my studies about Software-Defined Networking (SDN).
I presented with my partner Inbar Shmaya.
The presentation introduced malicious software threats on SDN controllers and how we can detect those threats using Machine Learning algorithms.
Attached a link to the academic research and our power point file.
